# 🐍 A Python library for audio feature extraction, classification, segmentation and applications

## 💪 Ability
pyAudioAnalysis is a Python library covering a wide range of audio analysis tasks. Through pyAudioAnalysis you can:
 * Extract audio *features* and representations (e.g. mfccs, spectrogram, chromagram)
 * *Train*, parameter tune and *evaluate* classifiers of audio segments
 * *Classify* unknown sounds
 * *Detect* audio events and exclude silence periods from long recordings
 * Perform *supervised segmentation* (joint segmentation - classification)
 * Perform *unsupervised segmentation* (e.g. speaker diarization) and extract audio *thumbnails*
 * Train and use *audio regression* models (example application: emotion recognition)
 * Apply dimensionality reduction to *visualize* audio data and content similarities
